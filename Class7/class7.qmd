## Background
Today we will begin our exploration of some important machine learning methods, namely **clustering** and **dimensionality reduction**.

Let's make up some input data where for clustering where we know what the natural "clusters" are 

The function `rnorm()` can be useful here

```{r}
hist(rnorm(5000)) 
```

> Q. Generate random numbers centered at +3

```{r}
tmp <- c(rnorm(30, mean=3),
         rnorm(30, mean=-3))

x <- cbind(x=tmp, y=rev(tmp))
plot(x)
```


## K-means clustering

The main function in "Base R" for K-means clustering is called `kmeans()`

```{r}
km <- kmeans(x, centers = 2)
km
```


> Q. What component of the results object details the cluster sizes? 

```{r}
km$size
```

> Q. What component of the results object details the cluster centers? 

```{r}
km$center
```

> Q. What component of the results object detrails the cluster membership vector (i.e. our main result of which points lie in which cluster)? 

```{r}
km$cluster
```

> Q. Plot our clustering results with points colored by cluster and also add the cluster centers as new points colored blue

```{r}
plot(x, col=km$cluster)
points(km$centers, col ="blue", pch=15)
```

> Q. Run `kmeans()` again and this time produce 4 clusters (and call your result object `k4`) and make a results figure like above? 

```{r}
k4 <- kmeans(x, 4)
plot(x, col=k4$cluster)
points(k4$centers, col ="blue", pch=15)
```

The metric
```{r}
km$tot.withinss
k4$tot.withinss
```

> Q. Let's try different number of K (centers) from 1 to 30 and see what the best result is 

```{r}

ans <- NULL
for(i in 1:30) {
  ans <- c( ans, kmeans(x, centers = i)$tot.withinss)
}

ans
```

```{r}
plot(ans, typ="o")
```


**Key-point** K-means will impose a clustering structure on your data even if it is not there - it will always give you the answer you asked for even if that answer is silly!


## Hierarchial Clustering

The main function for Hierarchial Clustering is called `hclust()` Unline `kmeans()` (which does all the work for you) you can't just pass `hclust()` our raw input data. It needs a "distance matrix" like the one returned from the `dist()` function. 

```{r}
d <- dist(x)
hc <- hclust(d)
plot(hc)
```

To extract our cluster membership vector from a `hclust()` result object we have to "cut" our tree at a given height to yield separate "groups"/"branches". 

```{r}
plot(hc)
abline(h=8, col="red", lty=2)
```


To do this we use the `cutree()` function on our `hclust()` object:
```{r}
grps <- cutree(hc, h=8)
grps
```

```{r}
table(grps, km$cluster)
```

## PCA of UK food Data 

Import the dataset of food consumption in the UK:

```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <- read.csv(url)
x
```

> Q. How many rows and columns are in your new data frame named x: What R functions could you use to answer this?

```{r}
dim(x)
```


One solution to set the row names is to do it by hand...

```{r}
rownames(x) <- x[,1]
```

To remove the first column I can use the minus index trick

```{r}
x<- x[,-1]
```

A better way to do thids is to set the row names to the first column with `read,csv()`

```{r}
x <- read.csv(url, row.names = 1)
x
```


### Spotting major differences and trends

Is difficult even in this wee 17D dataset... 

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=T, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```


```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=F, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))

```

### Pairs plots and heatmaps

```{r}
pairs(x, col=rainbow(nrow(x)), pch=16)
```

```{r}
library(pheatmap)

pheatmap(as.matrix(x))
```


## PCA to the rescue

The main PCA function in "base R"  

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(t(x))
```

```{r}
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
attributes(pca)
```

To make one of main PCA result figure we turn to `pca$x` the scores along our new PCs. This is called "PC Plot" or "Score Plot" or "Ordination Plot", etc. 

```{r}
my_cols <- c("orange", "red", "blue", "green")
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2) + 
  geom_point(col= my_cols)
```


The second major result figure is called a "loadings plot" of "variable contributions plot" or "weight plot" 

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) + 
  aes(x= PC1, y= reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue")

```
